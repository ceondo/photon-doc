## Low Level Information Flux

This was created to define the workflow of the authentication
mechanisms. This starts from simple to complex workflow. Once
authenticated, a client is associated a session.

The different states of a user are:

* ANONYMOUS - Not authenticated U:ANO
* AUTHENTICATED - Authenticated with active session U:AUTH
* TWOFACTOR - Two factor authenticated with active session U:2FACT
* REMEMBERED - The authenticated session is older than a given age U:REM

The different states of a user session are:

* ANONYMOUS - No authentication is associated to the session S:ANO
* ACTIVE - Client is authenticated S:ACT
* REMEMBERED - remembered is just when the last authentication was 
  performed more than a configurable delay ago. S:REM

The information exchange is normally:

* login/password
* otp
* 


### Simple Login

1. User access a page without a session but which requires authentication. U:ANO
2. User is redirected to a login page. U:ANO
3. User input login + password.
4. If matches U:AUTH + S:ACT 
5. Redirect to the page.

### Two Factor Authentication

Same as simple login, but the access page requires a U:2FACT, at the
end of step 4, forward to another "login" which in fact requires to
input another bit of information. If failure, the user stay at the
U:AUTH level, if not, go to U:2FACT.

Note, we need to expire the two factor authentication at some points
in time.
