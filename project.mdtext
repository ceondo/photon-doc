Organization of a Photon project. This includes the directory and file
structure.

## Everything Is Done By Convention

Conventions rule the directory structure. This means that in practice
you can use any directory or file structure you want, but your code
will be easier to maintain if you follow the conventions. The use of
conventions over hard rules enforced at the code level means less code
to maintain and most of the time better performance.

## Structure of a Website Implemented With Photon

A website or a web application is a collection of components or `apps`
glued together in an URL space. For example, your website could be
composed of a series of small applications:

- a weblog;
- a series of reference articles;
- a home page listing the latest posts and articles;
- a micro blogging feed;
- a bookmark manager.

Of course, you may write each application by yourself or reuse
applications from third parties, but the key is **an application is
small**. An application just does one thing and does it well. You can have
200 applications in your website it will not affect performance at
all.

**Photon** allows you to easily run background tasks. For example, a
background task could be a small chat server which will notify each
client when a message arrives or take care of sending an email to
all your friends.

**So, each web application is project composed of many apps which may provide tasks**.

## Base Structure of a Project

~~~~~
myproject/config.php - Production configuration file
myproject/config.test.php - Testing configuration file
myproject/urls.php - URL map
myproject/templates - Custom templates
myproject/www - Assets like images, Javascripts, CSS
myproject/apps - Applications
myproject/apps/helloworld - Hello World application
~~~~~

## Base Structure of an App

~~~~~
helloworld/urls.php - URL map
helloworld/views.php - Views
helloworld/tests.php - Unit tests
helloworld/templates/helloworld - Application templates
helloworld/www/media/helloworld - Assets like images, Javascripts, CSS
helloworld/data - Optional data
helloworld/models.php - Optional models
helloworld/task.php - Optional tasks
~~~~~

Only the `tests.php`, `urls.php` and the `views.php` are in practice
needed. That is, you want to display something *the views* at a given
point in the URL space of your project *the URL map*.

If your application is only providing some tasks, you may have just
two files, `tests.php` and `task.php`.

Yes, a task is very simple, it is basically just a small piece of code
launched and monitored in the background by **Photon**. It listens on
a given [ZeroMQ][zmq] socket for some work and send the results either
directly as a synchronous task or not as an asynchronous task.
