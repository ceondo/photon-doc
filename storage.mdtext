title: Application Data Storage
description:
Photon does not inforce a given storage engine. We like MongoDB, but you can
use any storage you like, from RAM to text files, through whatever RDBMS or 
NoSQL system you want. Here are the principles you should follow in your
application to follow the Photon storage principles.

## Accept That Not Everybody Like Your Storage System

This is maybe the hardest one. When you are comfortable with a storage
system, you tend to see all the nice things you can do with but not
the issues related to it. You know how to write your code to take
maximum benefits of your storage system and to avoid the pain
points. But for other people, the pain points can be stoppers, for
example, they may not have the hardware to simply run your system. So
**do not write an application which requires a given storage**.

It is very easy to have a single and efficient level of abstraction to
allow anybody to write their own storage engine. 

For example, suppose you want to store log information for your
application, you can have a simple class with the methods:

    class Storage
    {
         public function store($timestamp, $category, $data);
         public function retrieve($criteria);
    }

Then, in your application, you just load your storage:

    use photon\config\Container as Conf;
    $class = Conf::f('myapp_storage', 'myapp\storage\Storage');
    $store = new $class();

by default, it is sane and use your class, which may use only
[SQLite][sqlite] or [MongoDB][mongodb], but you give the opportunity
for your users to write their own storage by exposing a simple API. It
is also very practical for unit testing.

## Photon Storages

By default in **Photon**, this rules is always inforced and we try to
always provide two storage implementations with *SQLite* and
*MongoDB*. This way, you have examples following two different
paradigms, RDBMS storage and document oriented.

The default storage implementation is *MongoDB*, that is, the
implementation if you but nothing in your configuration file. The
configuration keys follow a standard approach:
`photon_sessions_storage`, `photon_abtesting_storage`, etc.
