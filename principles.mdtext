## Photon Principles

The core priorities of the Photon project are:

- Speed.
- Ease of development.

Starting version 1.0 speed regressions will not be allowed. That is,
each new version of Photon will have to be at least as fast as the
previous if not better for a set of standardized tests.

## Technology

Daemon. Yes, a daemon in PHP. This works perfectly well as it is used
in combination with Mongrel2. Mongrel2 allows us to start/stop daemons
in PHP extremely easily without disruption of the requests. For
example, you can set your daemon to shut itself down after 500
requests or after reaching a certain level of memory consumption. You
let the mongrel2 process supervisor restart the process (it is PHP so
it is extremely fast) and you just enjoy automatic cleaning of the
memory leaks while getting an extremely robust system.

Depending on your system (that is, if you have many cores) you can run
many backend PHP processes to fully use your cores and get the maximum
out of your system. You can also have a smart way to start/stop PHP
backend processes depending on the load (you can even start them on
other systems).

## Methodology

In memory. The goal is to hit the disk only when really needed. So all
the tradeoffs are towards putting more in memory and have less disks
access and system calls.

Cryptography to allow stateless communication (signed cookies) and
permit authentication without the need to hit the database or even
open a connection to the database.

Smart "core" objects which are database independent even so most of
the code is structured to take benefit of MongoDB.

MongoDB, because it is fast and nicely answers our needs:

- Fast development of new models.
- No real needs of migrations, they can be handled at the code level on a running system.
- Memory mapped, that is, no disk access when the dataset is small.

Use PHP. This may be a surprising remark, but most of the frameworks
tend to reinvent the PHP builtin functions and classes, just don't do
it. Use PHP as much as possible, this is faster and safer on the long
run.

## Critics

It Sucks, I Cannot Use It On Shared Hosting. Yes, but the goal here is
to provide a high performance PHP framework for websites with
performance constraints. If you are on a shared hosting, you would be
better served with a already very fast framework like Pluf.

A daemon in PHP, PHP is a memory sieve, so we can forget about
it. Already the fast-cgi approach has a per children request limit
(500 by default) to kill and restart a children after a while to plug
the memory leaks. So, this is the same approach.

ømq is another piece of infrastructure we do not need. Yes and no, the
wonder of ømq is that we can even use it to dispatch the requests to
other processes (Python, Ruby, Java) to offload some of the work to
specialized systems.
