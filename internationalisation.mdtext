The internationalization (also known as i18n) and localization are an
easy step with **Pluf** as long as you start from the beginning to
think about it.

Learn more about [internationalization on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization).

What is really important to note, is that you can already apply all
the following steps to make your code translation ready and translate
only later. In fact, you should **definitely have a translation ready code** 
as the work to do so is small if done from the very beginning.

## In your configuration file ##

You need to provide the list of languages supported by your
application and load the translation middleware. The translation
middleware `Pluf_Middleware_Translation` must be loaded just after the
session middleware if you are using it. 

For example:

    $cfg['languages'] = array('en', 'fr', 'fr_QC', 'es');
    $cfg['middleware_classes'] = array(
         'Pluf_Middleware_Session',
         'Pluf_Middleware_Translation',
    );

The translation middleware can use session data to find which language
is to be returned to the user, that is why you need to put it after
the session middleware. 

The first available language in the language list, here `en` (English)
will be the default language of the application if no other languages
match the preferences of the visitor.

## Determination of the visitor language ##

In order of priority, the language is determined using the following
sequence:

1. The `pluf_language` session key.
2. The `pluf_language` cookie (you can change the name with the `lang_cookie` configuration key).
3. The user agent `Accept-Language` request header.
4. The first language in the configuration file.

In the particular case of a connected user, if the `pluf_language`
session key is not yet populated, the `$user->language` property of
the user will be used to first set the `pluf_language` session key.

## In the templates ##

You only need to use one function or one block to translate your
templates. The function is used when you need only to translate one
line without substitution of variables and the block is used when you
need either or both of substitution variables and plural forms.

Consider the following template fragment which is not translated:

    <h1>Pluf internationalization</h1>
    <p>To translate your code, use one of 
       the {$methods.count()} method(s):</p>
    <ul>
    {foreach $methods as $method}
       <li>Name: {$method.name}, 
           Description: {$method.description}.</li>
    {/foreach}
    </ul>
    </html>

Now the version ready for translation:

    <h1>{trans "Pluf internationalization"}</h1>
    {assign $n_methods = $methods.count()}
    <p>{blocktrans $n_methods}To translate your code, use 
       the following method:{plural}To translate your code, use 
       one of the {$n_methods} methods:{/blocktrans}</p>
    <ul>
    {foreach $methods as $method}
       <li>{blocktrans}Name: {$method.name}, 
       Description: {$method.description}.{/blocktrans}</li>
    {/foreach}
    </ul>
    </html>

### The **trans** function ###

The simple translation function: `trans` is used the following way:

    {trans "My string to translate"}

or

    {trans 'My string to translate'}

You cannot use variables within the string. This is perfect for small
strings in your templates.

### The **blocktrans** block ###

The block has **two** different ways to be called, one for the plural
form and one *normal* form.

#### The normal form ####

A simple example without variable subsitution:

    {blocktrans}This is a long text 
    that can be over multiple lines and that
    can be translated later.{/blocktrans}

You can also substitute variables within the string, but you cannot
call another function or block.

    {blocktrans}I like {$fruit}, {$vegetable} 
    and {$place}.{/blocktrans}

`{$fruit}`, `{$vegetable}` and `{$place}` will be replaced with their
corresponding value as in the rest of your template. 

#### The plural form ####

Example of use without substitution of variables:

    {blocktrans $counter}This is the singular 
    form.{plural}This is the plural form.
    {/blocktrans}

Depending of the value of `$counter`, the first and unique parameter
given to the block, the singular or the plural form will be selected.

In exactly the same way as the normal form, you can substitute
variables like that:

    {blocktrans $counter}I have one {$pcbrand}.
    {plural}I have {$counter} computers from several brands 
    including {$pcbrand}.
    {/blocktrans}

As you can see, this is pretty flexible.

## In your PHP code ##

In your code, you can use two function to translation your code:

 * `__`: For example `__('My simple string')`
 *  `_n`: For example `_n('Singular form.', 'Plural form.', $counter)`

The first function is to handle simple normal cases and the second one
to handle plural cases. If you want to perform variable substitution,
you can use the `sprintf` function like that:

    $place = 'Berlin';
    echo sprintf(__('I like %s.'), $place);
    echo sprintf(__('I like %s.'), 'Berlin');

See the [documentation of sprintf](http://www.php.net/sprintf).

If you have a key indexed array of values you want to substitute in a
string, you can use the special `Pluf_Translation::sprintf` function.

For example:

    $values = array('place' => 'Berlin',
                    'fruit' => 'apple',
                    'computer' => 'IBM');
    echo Pluf_Translation::sprintf(__('I have one %%fruit%%, one %%computer%% in %%place%%.'), $values);

This will display:

    I have one apple, one IBM in Berlin.

Or if you have translated the string `'I have one %%fruit%%, one %%computer%% in %%place%%.'` in French:

    J'ai une apple, un IBM Ã  Berlin.

## Updating/Creating language files ##

The translations are store in [GNU Gettext PO files](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). This storage format
allows to take benefit of all the set of utilities to parse the code
to extract the strings and to perform the translations. 

The `.po` files are stored as **YourApp/locale/LANG/yourapp.po**. For
example, the French translation of Pluf is in
**Pluf/locale/fr/pluf.po**. The particular form of a language, for
example the British English is stored in the **en_GB** folder.

The search order of the .po file is so that it will first try to find
the corresponding territory version, for example **fr_QC** and if it
is not available, it will default to use the main version **fr**. If
none are available, it will not load any language file.

### Extract the strings from the templates ###

The templates are not using a standard *gettext* format, so the first
step is to convert your templates into a version ready to be consumed
by the gettext extract tool `xgettext`.

Go in your application folder, for example:

    $ cd ~/myprojects/web/MyApp

Then run the following command:

    $ php /path/to/pluf/extracttemplates.php ./conf/myapp.php ./gettexttemplates

You will see that a list of files is extracted. Looking into the newly
created `gettexttemplates` folder, you will see all your templates
with a `.php` extension and inside them, only the strings from the
`trans` function and the `blocktrans` blocks.

These files can now be parsed by `xgettext`.


### Create the main .pot file ###

The `.pot` file is the template `.po` file used as a basis for the
other languages. This is basically a `.po` file without
translations. This is the only file you should create automatically
with `xgettext`.

Create first a `MyApp/locale` folder. Your template file will be
`MyApp/locale/myapp.pot`.

Go in your application folder:

    $ cd ~/myprojects/web/MyApp

And run the following commands, each command must be on a single line,
the backslash (\\) is here only for the presentation at the exception
of the one just before the (;) which is needed:

    $ xgettext -o myapp.pot -p ./MyApp/locale --force-po --from-code=UTF-8 \
          --keyword --keyword=__ --keyword=_n:1,2 -L PHP *.php
    $ find ./ -iname "*.php" -exec xgettext  -o myapp.pot -p ./MyApp/locale \
          --from-code=UTF-8 -j --keyword --keyword=__ --keyword=_n:1,2 \
          -L PHP {} \;

You can learn more about **xgettext** by typing `$ man xgettext` on
your system.

### Create a new translation for a language ###

Now consider you want to make the base French translation. Create a
folder `MyApp/locale/fr` and open [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/).

In the file menu, select *New catalog from POT file* and select the
`MyApp/locale/myapp.pot` file. 

Then go in the *Catalog > Settings...* menu and in the *Project Info*
tab, input the followings:

 * Project name and version: **MyApp 1.0**
 * Team: **French**
 * Language: **French**
 * Country: **France**
 * Charset: **UTF-8**
 * Source code charset: **UTF-8**
 * Plural forms: **nplurals=2; plural=n>1;**

Then in the *Paths* tab, input `../../` and click on Ok and in the
file menu save the file as `/MyApp/locale/fr/myapp.po`

If you wonder what are the plural forms, [the plural forms manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html) is available.

### Update a translation ###

Now, if you update your code, you need to have the new strings in your
`.po` file. What you have to do is first, update or recreate the
`.pot` file by first extracting the strings from the templates and
then running the *xgettext* utility.

Afterwards, open you `.po` file in **Poedit** and click on *Catalog >
Update from POT file...*. You will have some info, if everything looks
in order, for example that you do not have suddenly a lot less
strings, click on Ok. **It is always good to make a backup of your .po file before updating it from a .pot file**.

Now you can translate the new strings and update the old ones.
