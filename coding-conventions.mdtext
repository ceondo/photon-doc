The coding standards and conventions of Photon. How to write some nice 
looking and well structured code.

## The Conventions Are Simple

The base is the [PEAR Coding Standards][pearcs] with some special
cases. Read the code of **Photon** to have a good feeling of what is
done.

### Use namespaces

Each class must live in a namespace, the namespace is in lower case
and reflects the directory structure. For example:

    namespace yourapplication\views;
    
    class Base
    {
        public function foo($request, $match)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    class Other {}
    

is available in the file `src/yourapplication/views.php`, with the
`src` directory in your include path. This way, you can have many
classes in one file. The one file per class approach is not used as it
is extremely annoying when you want to have *just a small class* for a
data structure or as a little utility tool. For people used to code in
Python, this is effectively following the Python convention. This
convention as proved itself extremely robust over the years.

If you can throw an exception from your code, use an exeception from
your namespace or a [predefined exception](http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php) 
when it makes sense.

    namespace yourapplication\yourlib;
    class Exception extends \Exception {}
    class Foo
    {
        public function bar($what)
        { 
            // It will throw the \yourapplication\yourlib\Exception which
            // can be caught with:
            // catch (\Exception $e) {}
            // or to be fined grained:
            // catch (\yourapplication\yourlib\Exception $e) {}
            throw new Exception();
        }
    }

### No Interfaces and No Type Hints

If you unit test your code, these simply do not make sense. Type
hinting and interfaces, because of the dynamic nature of PHP, are
evaluated at runtime, this means, that each time you access a method,
function the check will be made. You basically check the same thing,
again and again, days after days.

So, just unit test correctly your code, this will catch all the
errors.

If you can come up with a good reason to use type hints and
interfaces, feel free to come on the list and discuss about it. I am
against them at the moment, only because I have yet to find a good
reason to use them.

### Minimize the Number of Variables

Do not do things like:

    $a = my_function_foo($input);
    $b = other_function($a);

This makes a copy of the data in `$a` and this makes the understanding
of the code harder because you have more variables to track in your
head.

    $b = other_function(my_function_foo($input));

### Leave a Blank Line Before a Return Statement

On a small function like the one below, it may looks futile, but as
soon as your functions start to have more than 5 lines, this makes the
`return` statement pop out and improves a lot the reading speed of the
code.

    function foo_bar($bing)
    {
        if (0 === strlen($bing)) { 

            return 'no bing!';
        }
        $bing = mb_strtoupper($bing);
     
        return $bing;
    }

### Keep a Space Before and After the Dot in Concatenation

This is again a readability issue, the added space allow quick in mind
tokenization of the code.

    $good = $old . 'foo' . substr($another, 1, 4) . ' bar';
    $bad = $old.'foo'.substr($another, 1, 4).' bar';

### Indent Ternary Operator When a Bit Long

This allow very fast scanning of the conditions and feels like a
compact if/then/else block.

    $foo = ('abc' === $foobar)
        ? 'abc' . 'foo' . substr($another, 1, 4) . ' bar'
        : 'not abc' . 'foo' . substr($another, 1, 4) . ' bar';

### Use an English Sentence as Exception Message

When you throw an exception from your code, the message must be a
clean and understandable message. It must start with an upper case
letter and end with a period. For example:

    throw new Exception(sprintf('The system was not able to open the file: %s.',
                                realpath($thefile)));

The trace will provide the coder with the needed information to debug
and fix the problem and the clean message will make your end users
feel good.

### Make Your If Statements Fast

It is a bit faster and clearer to put the constant first and to do an
exact equality match.

    if ('this is' === $good) {
        if ($this_is == 'bad') {
            // This will also automatically prevent you
            // to do by mistake an assignement in the if
            // block.
        }
    }

### Clean After Yourself

At the end of a request, **Photon** will not clean the global
scope. If you are opening a file, do not forget to close it. If you
open a connection which is not supposed to be permanent, close it too.

### Take Care of your Memory Usage

**Photon** is running as a daemon without a maximum memory usage, if
your application is reading data from the outside world and you have
no idea how big the data will be, you should pay attention. A good way
to avoid memory ballooning is to store the data in a memory stream
with swapping. For example:

    $fp = fopen('php://temp/maxmemory:5242880', 'r+');
    fputs($fp, generate_unknown_large_output());
    rewind($fp);
    // Operate on the data, for example check the size:
    $info = fstat($fp);
    $size = $info['size'];
    fclose($fp);

Here, you have the data in the `$fp` and if the data is bigger than
5MB, it will be swapped on disk. If below 5MB, as everything is done in
memory, it is really fast.


### Unit Test Everything

Really everything. You can easily run your tests from the command
line, it will save your day in the future.

### Keep the Logic Within 45 Lines

Your functions should not be more than 45 lines in length. Sometimes
you cannot really do so, but try. Long functions are hard to tests but
also hard to follow. 45 lines is usually what you can see in one go in
a text editor.

### Be Positive in Default Arguments

Ensure that the default argument is `true` not `false`. For example, compare:

~~~~~
function runNegative($what, $payload, $raw=false)
{
    if (!$raw) {
        $payload = json_encode($payload);
    } 
    ...
}

function runPositive($what, $payload, $encode=true)
{
    if ($encode) {
        $payload = json_encode($payload);
    } 
    ...
}
~~~~~

It is more natural to follow the positive way than the negative. 

### Do Not Include the Trailing Slash in Folders

If your function returns a directory/folder path, do not include the
trailing slash.

~~~~~
function thisIsBad()
{
    return '/var/log/photon/';
}
function thisIsGood()
{
    return '/var/log/photon';
}
~~~~~

This is the convention followed by all the functions, methods in PHP
and Unix tools.
